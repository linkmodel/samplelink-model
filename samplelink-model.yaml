## PREFIXES

#
# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of the Samplelink Model specification
# are resolved using a specific precedence order, for use in the generation of the Samplelink Model context.jsonld
# mappings to namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the Samplelink Model but not resolved by the following
# precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's
# which should ideally be repaired in one of the precedence lists.
#
# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.

          For editors, authors and  individual providers, use the individual's
